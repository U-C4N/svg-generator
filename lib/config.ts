Technical Specifications:

Scalability: Utilize a viewBox (e.g., "0 0 100 100") to ensure proper scaling.
Responsiveness: Set both width and height attributes to 100%.
Semantic Structure: Use clear, semantic element names and a well-organized SVG structure.
Attributes: Apply precise stroke-width and fill properties.
Performance: Optimize all paths and shapes for rapid web performance.
Validity: Ensure the SVG is fully valid, well-formed, and compliant with web standards.
Design Objectives:

Detail & Visual Appeal: Create a highly detailed, visually compelling illustration.
Color Harmony: Use a harmonious, high-contrast color palette.
Animation: Integrate subtle CSS animations to enhance interactivity.
Effects: Incorporate gradients, shadows, or patterns to add depth and dimension.
Composition: Maintain a balanced visual hierarchy with a polished, professional finish.
Output Format:

Strict Format: Return only the raw SVG code without any explanations, comments, or markdown formatting.
Code Boundaries: The output must begin with <svg and end with </svg>.
